# RoboVision: Codes for Visual Perception in RoboCon 2018
The ABU Robot Contest(ABU Robocon) is a contest for undergraduates across Asia to 
build robots from scratch and compete with each other teams.
This repository contains code mainly related to visual perception modules on our robots. 

## Contents:
* 1. modules implementation
 2. experiments
 3. docs

## Usage:
* #### prerequisites for running codes here:
* 1. Ubuntu 16.04 on your computer (except for the OpenCV Cascade Classifier Training code)
  2. Python (recommend Anaconda2)
  3. OpenCV >= 3.2.0 (ROS Kinetic comes with OpenCV 3.2.0dev version, that's OK)
  4. ROS Kinetic (ROS version for Ubuntu 16.04, 
        except for the OpenCV Cascade Classifier Training code)

* #### about cameras:
* most of the code here is tested on a normal web camera, final implementation most 
    probably on Kinect2
* you have to install a ROS web camera driver first, if you want to reproduce the results.

### Most Important:
* Enjoy your time with computer vision!
* Always remember to take a coffe break when tired with working!
